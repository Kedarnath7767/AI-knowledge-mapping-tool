# 🚀 Features

### 📤 1. Upload Any Dataset Format
Upload files in:

- CSV  
- Excel (XLS/XLSX)  
- TXT  

The system automatically:

- Detects sentence column  
- Generates ID/domain/label if missing  
- Cleans and normalizes the dataset  

---

### 🧠 2. Automatic NLP Pipeline
Every uploaded dataset is processed through:

- Named Entity Recognition (NER)  
- Relation Extraction  
- Cross-domain mapping  
- Knowledge graph data extraction  

---

### 🔍 3. Semantic Search
Powered by `sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)`:

- Generate embeddings  
- Search semantically similar sentences  
- View similarity score + domain + label  
- Fast and accurate retrieval  

---

### 🌐 4. Knowledge Graph Visualization
Built using **PyVis + NetworkX**:

- Entities = nodes  
- Relationships = edges  
- Each domain has a unique color  
- Fully interactive (drag, zoom, hover)  
- Physics engine for layout  

---

### 🧭 5. Overview Dashboard
- Total sentences  
- Unique domains  
- Label categories  
- Domain distribution graph  
- Dataset health check  

---

### 👨‍🎓 6. Student View
A simplified view for learning purposes:

- Key concepts  
- Domain summaries  
- Graph-based insights  

---

### 💬 7. Feedback System
Users can submit:

- Errors  
- Suggestions  
- Improvements  
- Comments per record ID  

Stored with timestamp and status tracking.  

---

### 🛠 8. Admin Tools
Admin role includes:

- Merge sentences  
- Delete records  
- Manage users  
- Inspect system data  
- Access feedback moderation  

Role-based access enforced.

---

### ⚙️ 9. User Preferences

# 📤 Dataset Format (Flexible)

Works with datasets containing:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| id | Unique row ID |
| sentence | Text content |
| domain | Subject category |
| label | Relation type |

If your dataset does **NOT** include these columns —  
The system will **automatically detect and generate them**.
